# Time-Series-Prediction-and-Forecasting-of-Apple.inc-Stock-Market-Index

Stock market analysis is a critical component of investment decision-making and economic forecasting. In this
project, we conducted a comprehensive stock market analysis of Apple Inc. using time series analysis techniques
to forecast future values of the closing index. Our goal was to identify the best-fit model that accurately predicts
the future performance of Apple Inc.'s stock. This analysis aims to demonstrate how time series analysis can be used to make informed investment decisions and identify emerging opportunities or risks in the stock market.

# Dataset Information: 

The historical stock market index data for Apple. from [Yahoo Finance]([https://finance.yahoo.com/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL)https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL). The dataset consists of stock market data for a company over a period of weeks, starting from March 27, 2017, and ending on April 28, 2023. The dataset contains information such as the date, opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, adjusted closing price, and volume of
stocks traded for each week. The data was collected and processed to obtain weekly average values of the open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume. The input data consisted of single CSV files:

- data.csv
  
Information about files

- data.csv: Preprocessed dataset
- Report.pdf: Contains the detailed report of the analysis including data preprocessing, model developments, and results.

# Discussion:

In this analysis, the  closing index of Apple Inc. is used as our response variable, and applied various time series analysis techniques,
including regression, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA, to develop models that can predict future values of
the closing index. The  evaluation of the models was based on overall prediction accuracy and error measures. The best-fit model
was identified as the one that achieved the highest accuracy and the lowest error measure. Achieved results of our analysis show
that the best-fit model has a baseline accuracy of 66.66% for predicting the future value of the closing index of Apple Inc.'s stock.
Our analysis highlights the potential of time series analysis in stock market analysis and provides insights that can inform investment decisions. However, it is important to note that stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and should be viewed as estimates rather than guarantees of future performance. Our findings can be used as a starting point for further analysis and to develop more sophisticated models that can provide more accurate forecasts.
